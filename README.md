You need Node.js at least version 15. You can find the latest release [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and at the time of writing it is 16.3.0.

Once Node.js is installed, you'll need to run from a terminal the following steps:

`cd client`

`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm run serve`

Upon success, and with the default settings, you should see a message such as the following

```
  vite v2.1.2 build preview server running at:

  > Local:    http://localhost:5000/
```

Now you can visit `http://localhost:5000/` on your browser and see application. You can expand the latency measuring panel by clicking on the expand arrows at the bottom right of the screen.
